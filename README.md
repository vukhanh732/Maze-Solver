# Maze Solver

This project is a maze solver visualizer created using Pygame. It includes Breadth-First Search (BFS) algorithm for maze-solving and offers a graphical user interface for maze creation and pathfinding visualization.

## Features

1. Draw walls on the grid to create your custom maze.
2. Place a start and end point anywhere on the grid.
3. Use the "BFS" button to start the Breadth-First Search algorithm.
4. Watch as the algorithm visualizes the pathfinding process, coloring visited cells in green and the shortest path in yellow.

## Usage

1. Run `main.py` to start the program.
2. Left-click and drag on the grid to draw walls.
3. Press "s" on the keyboard and click on the grid to place the start point.
4. Press "e" on the keyboard and click on the grid to place the end point.
5. Click the "BFS" button to start the Breadth-First Search algorithm.
6. If a path is found, it will be highlighted in yellow.
7. If no path is found, a "No path found!" message will be displayed on the screen.
8. Click the "Reset" button to clear the maze and start over.
